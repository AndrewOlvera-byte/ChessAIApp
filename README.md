Simple implementation of a chess game with an AI opponent. The current model being used in the implementation(not included in repo) has a Convolutional Neural Network architecture, and in inference outputs a tanh value between -1 and 1. It is a probability spread on if the board representation evaluates on average to conclude in a win for your side. This evaluation is then used in a Minimax search algorithm with alpha beta pruning across all legal moves to find the optimal move to use.
